<!--more--> **Why This Gig?**

I've been a fan ever since I first heard "Hong Kong Garden" in 1978. But I've never been a huge fan. The only albums I have are compilations. I've never seen her live and as her live appearances are becoming rather rare, I thought was about time I put that right.

**Support**

The support was Viv Albertine and her band. I haven't taken any notice of Viv Albertine since the Slits split up. You can hear the Slits in Albertine's music, but it hasn't dated anywhere near as well as Siouxie's music. Someone on Twitter suggested that it was a lot like watching Phoebe from Friends. And I can't really argue with that.

**Headline**

The second Siouxsie walked onstage, it was clear that something special was happening. The hall was full of Siouxsie fans who were making up for the fact that they hadn't seen her play for five or six years. The first song was instantly recognisable as "Happy House" and as it started everyone stood up spontaneously - something that I've never seen at the RFH before.

As I don't know Siouxsie's albums well, I didn't realise that she was playing the whole of [_Kaleidoscope_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001KEMXNC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B001KEMXNC&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21), but on the evidence of this show it's an album that I should really check out.

After the album, the band took a short break before coming back to play a brief greatest hits set. And then an encore of (to me) more obscure stuff.

I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to see this gig. But I'm glad I went. It was a great show.
