<!--more--> **Why this gig?**

Because I saw a TBMG show at the Royal Festival Hall about three years ago and it was one of my favourite gigs of all time. As I left that show I decided that I'd go and see them whenever I could.

Nope

**Headline**

When I last saw They Might Be Giants, their latest album was the great children's collection [_Here Comes Science_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003J61TGG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B003J61TGG&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21). Since then they have released two new albums ([_Join Us_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005BX7702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B005BX7702&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21) and [_Nanobots_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BH7XDT0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00BH7XDT0&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21)), both of which I've found slightly disappointing.

So it was, in my opinion, a shame that the set list was rather heavily biased toward _Nanobots_ and that _Here Comes Science_ was completely forgotten. Of course, old favourites like "Birdhouse in Your Soul", "Anna Ng" and "Doctor Wurm" were played but there was rather too much filler for my tastes and it all fell rather flat.

I don't know if it was just a bad night or whether I just wasn't in the right mood for some reason. I've heard good reports from other nights on the tour and the audience at the Shepherds Bush Empire seemed to enjoy it, but it just didn't work for me.

I think TMBG just fell off my "must see whenever possible" list.
