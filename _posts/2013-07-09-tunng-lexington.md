Can't find any video from the night, so that's from a few days earlier.

**Why This Gig?**

Because Tunng are fantastic and I see them whenever I can. You should  too.

**Support**

I didn't realise until the afternoon before the gig, but the support were Conquering Animal Sound. I've seen them before a couple of years ago (coincidentally, also at the Lexington) so I knew what to expect. I can definitely see the connect to the psychedelic folky vibe of Tunng and friends, but there's also more than a drop of Bjork in there too. They are from Glasgow and don't seem to get down to London that often. But given how much I've enjoyed both the performances that I've seen, I'll definitely be looking out for them in the future.

**Headline**

The last time I saw Tunng was at the Forum in Kentish Town. The Lexington is a far smaller venue so this gig feels a lot cosier. This show (or, more accurately, the similar one they played the previous night) is the first time Tunng have played together for two years and it really looked like they were enjoying themselves. They have a new album, called [Turbines](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CL8DXTO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00CL8DXTO&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21), to promote and this was the first time they had played most of the new songs live. The new songs were scattered pretty evenly through the set and they stood up really well against the older, better known, material.

A lot of the audience were clearly big fans of the band. Old songs were applauded after only a couple of bars and many of the new ones got a cheer of recognition too - not bad for an album that has only been out for a few weeks. Towards the end they started taking requests from the audience and that led to some of the evening's best performances with "Soup", "Woodcat" and the final encore of "Bullets".

Tunng have been missing from the scene for far too long. It's great to see them back. They'll be back in October when they are playing at Heaven. I've already got my ticket - I highly recommend that you get one too.

There's [a page for this gig](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/tunng/2013/the-lexington-london-england-1bd959e4.html) on Setlist.fm, but no-one has filled it in yet.

**Reviews**

The mainstream's music reviewers seem to have missed this show completely.
