**Why this gig?**

Elbow are a bit of a guilty pleasure. It was several years after the release of [_The Seldom Seen Kid_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00IF3Z7IE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00IF3Z7IE&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21&linkId=XZM3L3C77527FSSC) that I realised that a number of songs that had slowly seeped into my consciousness were all by the same band and from the same album. A couple of years ago I went to see them at the O2 and enjoyed it, but decided that I didn't really need to see them again (not being a huge fan of arena gigs). But when they announced some smaller shows I thought it was worth getting a ticket.

**Support**

Support was a singer called Laura Groves. I think she might be interesting in a smaller venue, but from the balcony of the Hammersmith Apollo I didn't really get her.

**Headline**

I think this show may have killed Elbow for me. I mean, yes, I'll always think that [_The Seldom Seen Kid_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00IF3Z7IE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00IF3Z7IE&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21&linkId=XZM3L3C77527FSSC) is a great album but, really, nothing they've done before or since comes close. There are a couple of interesting things on [_Build A Rocket Boys_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004NZ4WJI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B004NZ4WJI&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21&linkId=SBU2RVAUIBDNE6TV), but their [latest album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00IOVNK72/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00IOVNK72&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21&linkId=AXGORQXGULLOLFMY) is just "Elbow by numbers".

And, unfortunately, the show has rather a lot of the new album. And also, older albums. There are only three songs from _The Seldom Seen Kid_. They are done well, but it's not enough to raise this gig above the distinctly mediocre.
