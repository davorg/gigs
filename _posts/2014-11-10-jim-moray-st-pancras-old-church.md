**Why this gig?**

I've seen (and enjoyed) Jim Moray a few times over the last couple of years. But he's always been a support act of a guest star. I thought it was about time I saw one of his gigs. And St Pancras Old Church is always a nice venue for a folky gig.

**Support**

The support act were called the Captain's Biscuits. They're a pretty standard folk trio - two women singing and a man on guitar. It's really nice.

**Headline**

As I said, I've always enjoyed seeing Jim Moray live. And I like shows at this venue. But something didn't reeally click for me here and I can't put my finger on it. Moray was on good form. The performances were great. But I just wasn't in the mood, I guess.

After forty-five minutes, he took a quick break. And I left.

But I'll definitely be going back to more of his gigs in the future.
