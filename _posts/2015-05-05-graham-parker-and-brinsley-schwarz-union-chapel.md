(Can't find any video from the night, so here's the hit single from 1978)

**Why this gig?**

So I can tick off another entry in my "I-Spy Book of 70s Rock Stars". Actually two, as Brinsley Schwartz was involved in a lot of music that I enjoyed a lot back in the mid to late 70s.

**Support**

Support is [Tristan Mackay](http://tristanmackay.com/). Bit of solo rhythm and blues with a slightly modern touch - there's a bit of looping thrown in. Enjoyable stuff.

**Headline**

Graham Parker has been around forever. And he hasn't stopped recording new songs since his brief moment in the public eye in the late 1970s. And a lot of the audience seem to have followed his career closely since then as every song he plays gets a big cheer of recognition. I only recognise a couple of hit singles.

The music is basic stuff from a completely different age. Some of you might be old enough to remember when R'n'B was what middle-aged men played in smokey rooms at the back of a pub - and not the over-produced saccharine monstrosity it has now become. That's the era the Graham Parker's music comes from. And in my opinion there's still a place for it. Sure it can be a bit basic and repetitive. But sometimes that's what you want.

But, to be honest, when I want rhythm and blues, I want a rhythm and blues band. Guitar, bass and drums. Perhaps some keyboards. That's a rhythm and blues band. That's the combination that gives rhythm and blues its power. If I have one complain about this show, it's that there wasn't a band. It was two guitarists and singers. And I don't think that line-up shows off rhythm and blues to its best advantage.

So I'm glad I went. And I might well go and see Graham Parker and the Rumour if they play again. But I'm unlikely to want to see Graham Parker again without a band backing him.
