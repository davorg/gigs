**Why this gig?**

I've written before about how much I love Annie Eve, so this gig was a no-brainer for me. Then I saw that Faroe was supporting and I was in heaven.

**Support**

Two supports tonight. She & I are two sisters. One of them plays piano and they both sing. It's really nice, gentle stuff and I hope to see them again at some point.

The second support is Faroe. I've already seen her twice this year - supporting both [Paper Aeroplanes](https://gigs.dave.org.uk/2013/05/paper-aeroplanes-bush-hall/) and [The Magnetic North](https://gigs.dave.org.uk/2013/06/the-magnetic-north-islington-assembly-hall/). And I was really happy to have the chance to see her again. I really like her songs and her laid-back style was a perfect support for Annie Eve. I hope I get to see her again next year.

**Headline**

Annie Eve just gets better and better. Three months on from the [EP launch show](https://gigs.dave.org.uk/2013/09/annie-eve-st-pancras-old-church/), her performance has become far more confident. She plays still, emotionally intense songs that require great concentration from the audience. Other performers might struggle to make that connection in the small back room of a pub, but she makes it appear effortless. The audience clearly love her.

Annie Eve is the best new act I have seen this year. If there's any justice at all in the world then everyone will know who she is by this time next year. I recommend that you get along to one of her shows while she is still playing small venues like this.
