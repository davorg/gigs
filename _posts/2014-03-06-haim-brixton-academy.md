**Why this gig?**

Because I saw HAIM [back in December](https://gigs.dave.org.uk/2013/12/haim-forum/) and I thought they were great. And until they stop being great I shall see them live at every opportunity. (Actually, I bought the ticket for this show before the show in December because I had a sneaking suspicion that I'd want to see them again as soon as possible.)

**Support**

The support was a band called Jungle. I enjoyed them, but unfortunately, they have a completely un-Googlable name so I can't find their web site or tell you anything useful about them.

**Headline**

On [the album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BPQC1AK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00BPQC1AK&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21), HAIM come across as a nicely-produced slice of Californian pop-rock. See them live and it's a completely different story. They are out-and-out rock chicks. There's shouting, incandescent guitar solos and dirty stories. Not to mention some great tunes (including, as you'll see from the video above, their now-standard cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Oh Well").

Last time, my only slight reservation was that the show was a bit short. They've now made it a little bit longer. They now play every song on the album (adding the title track, which was the only song missing previously) and another cover version (Beyonce's "XO" apparently - not that I recognised it, of course). In total the show now runs to about an hour and a quarter. Once they have a second album out and can play for 90 minutes they'll be unstoppable.

Only two years ago, they played their first London gig in a Dalston pub. If you don't get to see them soon, they'll be playing stadiums.
