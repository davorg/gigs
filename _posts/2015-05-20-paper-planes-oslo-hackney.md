**Why this gig?**

For the same reasons as I gave when I [last saw them](/2014/11/paper-aeroplanes-union-chapel/) in November.

**Support**

Two support acts. First, [Anna Pancaldi](http://www.annapancaldi.com/) who I thought was absolutely wonderful. I'll definitely be looking out to see her again as soon as possible. Then there was [Michael Schulte](http://www.michaelschultemusic.com/en/home.html) who I also enjoyed.

**Headline**

Paper Aeroplanes get better and better each time I see them. Their new album Joy is an absolute masterpiece and the songs from it slot seamlessly into the set.

This band deserve to be huge. I recommend seeing soon - it can't be long before they stop playing intimate venues like this.

The set list is [on setlist.fm](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/paper-aeroplanes/2015/oslo-london-england-4bc84752.html).
