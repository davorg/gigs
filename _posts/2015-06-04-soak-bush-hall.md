No video from the night, so here's a recent single.

**Why this gig?**

I saw Soak when [she supported Chvrches](/2014/03/chvrches-forum/) last year. At the time I said that I'd look out for her playing in London again. This was the first date that I spotted.

**Support**

Support was from Alex Burey. I'm writing this three weeks after the show and I can't remember anything about him.

**Headline**

If you travel on the London underground much, then you'll know who Soak is. There have been posters advertising her [debut album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00TJEILIQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00TJEILIQ&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21&linkId=UOIIUXSQR65E7BXW) all over stations for the last few weeks. The record company obviously have great faith in her.

It's a confidence that she repays in spades. She seems comfortable on the stage, introducing most of the songs with a little anecdote. She has an easy rapport with the audience. And the audience clearly love her.

The songs are great. It's hard to believe that some of them were written when she was about 14 (she's still only 19). There's a maturity to her writing that marks her out as something special.

It looks like this is going to be her year. She already has a [headlining show at the Union Chapel](https://www.songkick.com/concerts/23924193-soak-at-union-chapel) arranged for October. I have my ticket. You should come too.
