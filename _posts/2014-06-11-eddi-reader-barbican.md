**Why this gig?**

Because Eddi Reader is one of the loveliest people working in the music industry.

Because "[Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txapREGWHp0)" is still one of the best songs for getting me into that summer mood.

Because I saw her at the Union Chapel a couple of years ago and it was a great show.

**Support**

Support came from Kris Drever & Éamonn Coyne - a pair of singer/songwriters from Scotland. It was pleasant enough stuff, but nothing really distinguished it from all the other Scottish singer/songwriters.

There was one nice point when Eddi came out and joined them for a song. Apparently they had no idea she was going to do that.

**Headline**

I don't have too much to say about this, to be honest. It was all slightly disappointing. Eddi has a new album out (called [_Vagabond_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00H5HVD0M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00H5HVD0M&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21)) and I know she was touring to promote it but, on the evidence of this show, it's not a very good album. I know that twenty-five years have passed since [_First of a Million Kisses_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000025L5H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000025L5H&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21) and I know that people mature and change, but I don't really want to hear pop stars from my youth singing standards like "Moon River".

She still has a fantastic voice and great stage presence. When she sings "Perfect" and "The Moon is Mine" it's wonderful. But a lot of the other material was a bit of a let-down I'm afraid.
