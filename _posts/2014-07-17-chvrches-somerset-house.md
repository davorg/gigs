**Why this gig?**

Because it's Chvrches and they're one of the best bands around currently. And because I've never been to one of the summer shows at Somerset House before.

**Support**

Support is from Emilie Nicolas. From the set-up as she walked on stage with her band, I worried that they might be a bit of a Chvrches clone band, but I was wrong. She was a lot more soulful than Chvurches - at times reminding me of Lorde, Banks or Goldfrapp. It was all pretty enjoyable stuff. I won't be going out of my way to see her again, but I wouldn't complain at all if she was support at another gig I was at.

**Headline**

And then we have Chvrches. It's only a few months since I [last saw them play](https://gigs.dave.org.uk/2014/03/chvrches-forum/). And, to be honest, not a lot has changed in  that time. This gig is obviously still part of the same tour to promote [their debut album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00DCQ2DC2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00DCQ2DC2&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21). The stage looks exactly the same; the performance is pretty similar; even the set-list is (as far as I can remember) identical.

Not that that's a bad thing. It's still a great show. They play pretty much all of the album and nothing else. It's a great album, but it would be good if they could break it up a bit. Perhaps throw in an obscure B-side. Or a cover version.

Because, as I said last time, the only real disappointment here is the length of the set. They leave the stage after only fifty minutes or so. Even after the encore, the whole thing has only taken an hour. Hopefully, once they have a couple more albums under their belt they'll be able to stretch that out to ninety minutes or more - which is more what you'd expect a major band to do.

In the meantime though, they're still a great band to see live. I'm already looking for news of their next London show.
