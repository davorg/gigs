**Why this gig?**

Because [Annie Eve](/acts/annie-eve/) is great and if there's any justice in the music industry, she won't be playing tiny venues like this for very much longer.

**Support**

The support was [Jay Brown](http://www.iamjaybrown.com/). I'd never heard of her before, but I really enjoyed her songs. I'll be looking out for her again in the future.

**Headline**

Playing to that [church full of record industry people](/2013/09/annie-eve-st-pancras-old-church/) last September obviously paid off - [Annie's first album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KOFN00I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00KOFN00I&linkCode=as2&tag=davblog-21) is coming out later this month. So there's a lot of new stuff played tonight. And it's all really good. She's been growing as a songwriter. Some of the new stuff is really different to her older material, but the quality is just as high as it ever was.

I've said it before, but I'll keep on saying it until it comes true. Annie Eve deserves to be huge. If you haven't listened to her yet, please give her a try.
